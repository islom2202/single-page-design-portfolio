## 4. Features that I didn't know
Small features that i learned alongside building project
1. **':where'** - pseudo-class in CSS is used to simplify and minimize longer CSS selectors in a stylesheet, helping to avoid repetition and reduce code:
```
.prev, .next{
  opacity: 0;
}
.parent:hover :where(.prev, .next){
  opacity: 1;
}
```
